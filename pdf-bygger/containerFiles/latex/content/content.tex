% Several elements use the \addvspace command. When two elements next to each other uses this kind of space, the highest value is chosen.
 % For example:
    % some paragraph text
    % \addvspace{16pt}
    % \addvspace{32pt}
    % some title text
% in this case only 32 pt of vertical space is added between the elements.
